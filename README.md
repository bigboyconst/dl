# Deep Learning Project

This is a personal project of mine where I want to learn the specifics of how deep learning and neural networks work. This repo is my notes and code for this purpose.

## Structure

The project structure looks something like this:
- `data/`: Training and test data for the models.
- `notes/`: LaTeX notes for the mathematical concepts needed.
- `src/`: Where the project's source code lives.
- `build/`: Built binaries.
